# Next Steps After Adding Secrets ‚úÖ

You've successfully added the 3 Vercel secrets to GitHub! Now let's push the workflows and test them.

---

## Step 1: Verify Secrets (1 minute)

Go to your GitHub repository:
1. Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. You should see:
   - ‚úÖ `VERCEL_TOKEN`
   - ‚úÖ `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
   - ‚úÖ `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`

**All 3 present?** Great! Continue to Step 2.

---

## Step 2: Enable GitHub Actions (1 minute)

1. Still in repository Settings
2. Click **"Actions"** ‚Üí **"General"** (left sidebar)
3. Under "Actions permissions":
   - Select ‚úÖ **"Allow all actions and reusable workflows"**
4. Under "Workflow permissions":
   - Select ‚úÖ **"Read and write permissions"**
   - Check ‚úÖ **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
5. Click **"Save"**

---

## Step 3: Push All Workflow Files (3 minutes)

Open your terminal/command prompt in the `heavens-above` folder:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd heavens-above

# Check what files are ready to commit
git status

# Add all workflow files and documentation
git add .github/workflows/
git add *.md
git add .eslintrc.json .prettierrc jsdoc.json vercel.json

# Commit everything
git commit -m "feat: add GitHub Actions workflows with Vercel deployment"

# Push to your repository
git push origin main
```

**If you get an error about remote:**
```bash
# First time? Set up remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/heavens-above.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Step 4: Watch Workflows Run (2 minutes)

1. Go to your GitHub repository in browser
2. Click **"Actions"** tab (top navigation)
3. You should see:
   - A workflow run starting (triggered by your push)
   - "Continuous Integration" workflow running
   - "Deployment Pipeline" workflow running

**Click on "Deployment Pipeline"** to watch it deploy!

---

## Step 5: Get Your Deployment URL (2 minutes)

1. In the Actions tab, click on the **"Deployment Pipeline"** run
2. Click on **"Deploy to Vercel Production"** job (left side)
3. Wait for it to complete (2-3 minutes)
4. Look for this line in the logs:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Deployed to production: https://heavens-above-xxxxx.vercel.app
   ```
5. **Copy that URL!**
6. Open it in a new browser tab
7. **Your site is live!** üéâ

## Step 6: Quick Test - All 7 Workflows (15 minutes)

Now let's test each workflow to generate evidence for your assignment.

### Test 1: CI Workflow ‚úÖ (Already ran!)
The push to main already triggered this. Check Actions ‚Üí Continuous Integration

### Test 2: Deployment ‚úÖ (Already ran!)
Also triggered by push to main. Check Actions ‚Üí Deployment Pipeline

### Test 3: Code Review Workflow (3 minutes)

```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b test-code-review

# Make a small change
echo "// Test code review workflow" >> src/utils.js

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "test: trigger code review workflow"
git push origin test-code-review
```

Now create a Pull Request:
- Go to GitHub ‚Üí Pull requests ‚Üí New pull request
- base: `main`, compare: `test-code-review`
- Click "Create pull request"
- Title: "Test: Code Review Workflow"
- Click "Create pull request"

**Check the PR:**
- See automated checks running
- See review checklist comment
- See PR size label

### Test 4: Documentation Workflow (2 minutes)

```bash
# Go back to main
git checkout main

# Update README
echo "\n## Test Documentation\nTesting documentation deployment." >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: test documentation workflow"
git push origin main
```

**Check:** Actions ‚Üí Documentation Deployment

### Test 5: Scheduled Tasks (1 minute - Manual)

1. Go to Actions ‚Üí Scheduled Tasks
2. Click "Run workflow" (right side)
3. Select task: `data-refresh`
4. Click "Run workflow"

**Check:** Watch it run and complete

### Test 6: Dependency Updates (1 minute - Manual)

1. Go to Actions ‚Üí Dependency Updates
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Click "Run workflow"

**Check:** May create a PR if updates are available

### Test 7: Custom Workflow - Release (2 minutes)

```bash
# Make sure you're on main
git checkout main
git pull

# Create a release tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

**Check:** 
- Actions ‚Üí Custom Workflow
- Releases ‚Üí See new release v1.0.0

---

## Step 7: Collect Evidence (10 minutes)

### Take Screenshots:

1. **Actions Overview**
   - Actions tab showing all 7 workflows

2. **CI Workflow Success**
   - Continuous Integration run with green checkmarks

3. **Deployment Success**
   - Deployment Pipeline showing Vercel URL in logs

4. **Pull Request with Checks**
   - Your test PR with automated checks and comments

5. **Artifacts**
   - Any workflow run ‚Üí Scroll to bottom ‚Üí Artifacts section

6. **GitHub Release**
   - Releases page showing v1.0.0

7. **Live Site**
   - Your Vercel deployment URL open in browser

### Download Artifacts:

For each workflow run:
1. Click on the run
2. Scroll to bottom
3. Download artifacts (if any)

### Export Logs:

For main workflows:
1. Click workflow run
2. Click "..." (top right)
3. "Download log archive"

## Step 8: Verify Everything Works ‚úÖ

Check this list:

- ‚úÖ All 7 workflow files in `.github/workflows/`
- ‚úÖ CI workflow ran successfully
- ‚úÖ Deployment workflow deployed to Vercel
- ‚úÖ Got Vercel deployment URL
- ‚úÖ Site is accessible at Vercel URL
- ‚úÖ Code Review workflow ran on PR
- ‚úÖ Documentation workflow ran
- ‚úÖ Scheduled task ran manually
- ‚úÖ Dependency update ran manually
- ‚úÖ Release workflow created GitHub release
- ‚úÖ Have screenshots of all workflows
- ‚úÖ Have downloaded some artifacts

**All checked?** You're ready to submit! üéâ

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Deployment fails with "Unauthorized"
**Solution:** 
- Check secrets are added correctly
- Verify no extra spaces in secret values
- Try re-creating the VERCEL_TOKEN

### Issue: Workflows not appearing in Actions tab
**Solution:**
- Verify files are in `.github/workflows/` folder
- Check YAML syntax (no errors)
- Ensure Actions are enabled in Settings

### Issue: Can't push to repository
**Solution:**
```bash
# Set up remote if needed
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/heavens-above.git

# Or if remote exists but wrong
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/heavens-above.git
```

### Issue: Vercel deployment succeeds but site shows error
**Solution:**
- Check if `public` folder exists
- Verify `vercel.json` is correct
- Check Vercel dashboard for deployment logs

---
