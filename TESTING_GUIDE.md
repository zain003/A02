## Overview
This guide provides instructions for testing and validating the GitHub Actions workflows.

## Prerequisites
- GitHub repository with workflows configured
- Appropriate permissions (write access)
- GitHub CLI (optional, for advanced testing)

## Testing Individual Workflows

### 1. Continuous Integration (ci.yml)

#### Test Method 1: Push to Branch
```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b test-ci

# Make a small change
echo "// Test comment" >> src/utils.js

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "test: trigger CI workflow"
git push origin test-ci
```

#### Test Method 2: Create Pull Request
1. Push changes to a branch
2. Create PR to main/master
3. Observe CI checks running

#### Expected Results
- âœ… Tests run on multiple Node.js versions
- âœ… Linting checks complete
- âœ… Security audit runs
- âœ… Build status aggregates results

#### Artifacts Generated
